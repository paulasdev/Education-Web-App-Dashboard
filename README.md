## 📄 About

**Growly** is a responsive education dashboard interface created to showcase modern UI/UX principles and front-end development techniques. The project simulates a learning platform where users can view courses, track progress, and explore lessons—all within a clean, engaging layout.

The focus of Growly is to:

- Practice advanced CSS Grid and Flexbox layouts
- Implement responsive design for multiple devices (desktop, tablet, mobile)
- Enhance interactivity using vanilla JavaScript
- Apply custom styling inspired by real-world design systems
